     <p>SeniorView is designed to supervise elders or loved ones at home. Developed using Android Studios (Java, XML, SQLite), It alerts caretakers if a loved one needs help or assistance. SeniorView acts as a personal digital assistant for
       seniors. My application monitors the senior’s activity when they are
       alone. This allows the caretaker to be informed and can write digital
       notes. Such as a reminder to take a
               pill
               at a certain time.</p>
<p>I wanted to develop an app that served a
greater purpose for humanity. I thought about my grandmother and it was
at that moment an idea came to
        mind for my app.</p>

<h2>Abstact</h2>
<p>
          My Grandmother has been one of my caretakers ever since I was born.
After many years, her age made her more susceptible to illness. She
contracted dementia a mental illness that affects memory loss, and
hallucinations. Because of her condition, the
          roles had been switched. I have become her caretaker. My
Grandmother needs constant supervision and this can be a difficult task.
 With the combination of school, work, and social life it can be very
difficult to watch over her when she is
          alone at home. Medical alert systems can help keep the
caretaker alerted if something happens at home. However, these systems
can come with a price and may not be available. As you know, phones now
have many functionalities not limited to
          just calling another person. Phones are almost always carried
and used by people whenever they go to work, school, or even staying at
home. A few of the many functionalities of a modern phone include
sensors, GPS, camera, etc. Utilizing the
          phone’s capabilities, we can combine the functions and create a
 helpful app to aid our dependent.
        </p>




<h2>Design Process</h2>


        <p> It was concerning after witnessing my grandmother fall several
       times. This is especially worrisome if this was to happen if she was
      alone at home. This is how my idea came to fruition. The idea was to
      design an alert system that can be
              easily accessed via phone.
              Also, it would allow my grandmother to contact us through video
      chat if we were away from home. A possible constraint to this was that
      it may be difficult for a senior to navigate a modern phone. To solve
      this, the UI must be simple to
              navigate, easy on the eyes, and distinguishable.</p>


            <p>Preliminary programs were written to test the app
      functionalities individually. Barebones applications were developed
      before developing the full app. One of them included a class for
      accessing a plant SQLite database to filter through
              queried plant names and species. The basic logic for storing,
      retrieving, and searching was implemented for the Note function. Keeping
       the development process modular was key to testing and experimenting.</p>

<br><br>
<h2>Functionalities</h2>

<p>My app, SeniorView allows a caretaker to supervise their dependent without the need to be around. When a caretaker is away from the senior, <i>SeniorView</i> introduces a variety of options for them to check on them via by phone.
        One
        of the main functions is <i>Supervise</i>. <i>Supervise</i> allows the caretaker to access the dependent’s phone remotely with their own phone, powered by <i>TeamViewer</i>. Furthermore, the caretaker would then have complete access to
        their
        phone, accessing their camera and other apps. The <i>Supervise</i> function is a direct approach for monitoring the dependent. I will discuss <i>SeniorView</i>’s other functions along with the <i>Supervisor</i>
 function in more details
        below.
        Another main function for my app is the respective modes for
dependent users and the caretaker user. These modes have different
functions from each other. The purpose for these different modes is to
have a simple UI for the dependent
        while
        the caretaker can navigate through a more complex UI to manage
the activities for the dependent.</p>

<img src="SeniorView_App_files/caretakerMode.jpg" alt="caretakerMode" style="width:30%;height:50%">


<h2>Two different modes: Dependent Mode &amp; CareTaker Mode</h2>

      <p>SeniorView has two different modes. <i>Dependent Mode</i>
is the interface used by the senior or dependent. This feature is
simple to use and has minimal functionalities. They can open a video
chat using Line, instantly call
        their
        emergency contact, and view a list of notes written by the
caretaker. When entering <i>CareTaker Mode</i>, the user must enter a password to access this mode. The password is saved under shared preference and can be overwritten by
        creating a
        new password. After submitting the password, the user can now access <i>CareTaker Mode</i>. <i>CareTaker Mode</i> features <i>Supervise</i>, <i>Locate</i>, <i>Manage Contacts</i>, <i>Write a Note</i>, and <i>Print</i> functions. This
        mode
        allows a caretaker to manage and monitor the dependent.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Supervise</h2>


          <p>This function allows the caretaker to take direct control of
    the dependent’s phone as a last resort if the dependent does not
    respond. This function is in <i>CareTaker Mode</i> which can then be accessed by clicking on the
            <i>Supervise</i>
            button. The <i>Supervise</i> activity presents the user with two choices. </p>
          <img src="SeniorView_App_files/supervisePage.png" alt="supervisePage" style="width:75%;height:100%">
          <p><i>Allow Connect</i> button opens the <i>TeamViewer QuickSupport</i>. This generates an ID number to permit access for remote control from another device. The <i>Remote
              Control</i> button allows the user to control the dependents phone from their own. They would type in the generated ID from the <i>QuickSupport</i> of the dependent’s phone into the partner ID field and press remote control button. The
            user
            would then be able to access the dependent’s phone and access their features on the app.
          </p>
          <video autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted" loop="" width="100%">

                </video>

              <p>Supervise gives the caretaker full control of
        the dependent's device. Internet and the TeamViewer app is required for
        it to work. If the user doesn't have TeamViewer installed, the app will
        direct you to the
                marketplace.</p>

                <h2>Locate</h2>

                      <p>Due to advancing age, seniors become more likely to suffer from
                 dementia, Alzheimer's, memory loss, or some other mental illness. There
                 are many cases for loved ones to wander far away from home due to
                forgetting where they live. This
                        <i>Locate</i> function that allows the user to locate the dependent (the senior) globally on Google Maps.
                      </p>

                  <br><br>

                              <p class="sidenote"> If the dependent wanders away from home, the user would have an easier time locating them with this function.</p>
                              <h2>Manage Contacts</h2>

                                    <p>In <i>Dependent Mode</i>, the <i>Call</i> button either text
                            messages or calls the emergency contact or both. This is done by calling
                             the implicit intents Intent.ACTION_SENDTO and Intent.ACTION_DIAL. To
                            retrieve this information the
                                      user must have this data already stored in shared preference
                            by creating it in <i>Manage Contacts</i>.
                                    </p>

      <p class="sidenote">Entering to <i>Manage Contacts</i> in <i>CareTaker Mode</i> allows the user to edit the emergency contact.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>To create or edit an emergency contact, the user must enter <i>CareTaker Mode</i> and click on <i>Manage Contact</i> in the main menu of <i>Caretaker Mode</i>. The <i>Manage Contact</i> activity features 3 buttons. <i>Display
          Contact</i> Details retrieves the current emergency
contact’s name, phone number, and contact method from shared preference.
The user can add a new contact by clicking the <i>Add New Contact</i>
button which will take the user to
        another activity. This activity allows you to create a new
contact by inputting their name, phone number, and selecting a radio
button for the desired method of contact. Clicking the <i>Save</i> button will store this inputted data
        into shared preference. Going back to the first activity of <i>Manage Contact</i>, <i>Test Contact</i> allows the user to do a call test by retrieving the data from shared preference to check if the contact is working.

          <p class="sidenote">After adding an emergency contact, the user can now speed dial the contact in Dependent Mode.</p>
          <h2>Notes &amp; Write Notes</h2>

                  <p>In CareTaker Mode the user can create new notes for the
        dependent to read. These notes can be used for reminders for the
        dependent. For instance, if you wanted to remind the dependent to take
        two pills, or to remind them to exercise
                    they
                    would see your note under the <i>Dependent Mode</i>’s <i>Note</i> activity. To create a new note the user must go to the <i>Write a Note</i> activity found in the <i>CareTaker</i> menu. When the user first enters <i>Write a Note</i>,
                    the user is introduced with 3
                    options. The
                    user can add a new note, filter notes by subject on the
        search bar, or delete a subject of notes by tapping the garbage bin
        icon.
                  </p>

bin allows user
            to delete by subject. (2) CareTaker Mode - <i>Write A Note</i> -&gt; Add a New Note. (3) Dependent Mode - <i>Notes</i> allows user to view notes in Dependent Mode. User cannot edit here.</p>

            <p> Clicking on <i>Add a New Note</i> will open a new activity. The user is presented with a note template. The user can fill in the form, and tap <i>Send</i> once they are done. This will insert a new ID for the SQLite database. The
                        new note will be displayed in the first activity of <i>Write a Note</i>
             under a scrollable recycler view. To filter by subject, the
                        user inputs a subject name and then clicks on the magnifying
             glass icon. This will call the method viewQueryResults() which takes
            the user input data to a new recycler activity by placing the subject
            into intent.putExtra();. The
                        recycler
                        view will now only display notes that have the same subject
            name. The delete function works similarly to the filter. Once the user
            taps the garbage bin, the user would be taken to a new activity where
            they can delete all notes with
                        the given
                        subject name. Going back to <i>Dependent Mode</i> in the <i>Notes</i> activity, the user can view the notes that the caretaker updates.

        <p>This activity only activates when accelerometer detects
high velocity movement performed on the phone. The activity will open
prompting the user to make a choice: “Call for help” or “False alarm”.
When the user presses call for help,
          the
          call function will be activated and contacting the emergency
contact. If user presses “False alarm” it takes them back to the
Dependent Mode menu.

       after the device's accelerometer detects high velocity movement.
      Vibrant red of the "Call Help" indicates danger and that instinctive
      action must be done. Dull grey of the "False
                          Alarm" indicates not so immediate and a little more
      thought would be required to press.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This project made me realize that the possibilities are
endless for what you can program to help humanity. The phones we have
now are very versatile with a myriad of sensors and countless digital
resources we can utilize to perhaps advance
        civilization. I believe that everyone should at least learn
the basics for app development since apps have many uses for the modern
age and probably more so in the future. Overall, this was a fun and
interesting project. This experience
        will be
        used in my future career.
      </p>


      <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>This project was graded 10 out of 10. My instructor had
commented: “This is a very practical app, with potential beyond this
course”. </p>

        <h2> What I learned…</h2>
        <p>This project had introduced me to the basics of Android
development and had allowed me to exercise these skills into practical
applications. I had also learned how to access relational databases
through Java.
          In addition to learning Android development, I had further
practiced with UI/UX design from this project. After taking note of the
behaviors for how my elders use phones (displaying bold large fonts, and
 somewhat unfamiliar), I had catered
          the design for the app to fit their user experience. Dependent
 Mode being very simple and restricted, while CareTaker Mode being a bit
 more complex but still kept to a minimum.</p>

        <h2>Next Step</h2>
        <p>I wish to utilize my skills from this project for future
careers as I continue to practice Android development and UX design onto
 current and upcoming projects. I also wish to continue to further
develop my app and to one day make it
          available to the Google Play store. I hope that my
contributions would at least make a family feel assured to leave their
elder alone at home for a little while.</p>

        <p>P.S. My Grandmother is currently living in a care home with constant supervision.</p>
